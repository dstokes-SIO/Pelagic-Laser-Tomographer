HARDWARE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PLT Logger requires the following hardware:

- An Adafruit Feather M0 arduino microcontroller. The device has 32k of
  RAM, 262k of flash memory, an SD card controller, red and green status
  LEDs, and a series of pins used to access additional devices.

- An LSM9DS1 9-axis iNEMO inertial module (IMU). The sensor incorporates
  a 3D magnetometer, 3D accelerometer, and 3D gyroscope. The module also
  reports the internal device temperature.

- A MS5837 30 bar digital pressure sensor. The sensor reports water
  pressure and depth to a 2mm resolution. An included low-resolution
  water temperature sensor is not used.

- A TSYS01 digital temperature sensor. The high-resolution sensor reports
  water temperature between -5 and 50 C, +/- 0.1C.

- Three NEOPIX signle-wire-based multi-color LEDs. The LEDs are visible
  outside of the PLT pressure case and indicate device status and activity.

- An Adafruit DS3231 precision real-time clock. The clock provides a
  persistent date/time (with battery backup) and accurate timestamps used
  in log files.

- Two Adafruit LC709203F battery level monitors for the main and
  microcontroller battery. Each monitor provides battery voltage and an
  estimate of the charge level.

- An Adafruit TCA9548A 1-to-8 I2C bus multiplexor to support two battery
  level monitors.
